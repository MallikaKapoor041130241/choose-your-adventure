## Story Paths

### **The Left Hallway**
You step into the dark hallway. The sound of faint crying grows louder with each step. The air is colder here, and you can barely see. The walls feel damp as you brush your hand against them to guide yourself forward.

Suddenly, the crying stops. The silence is deafening. You hear a faint whisper directly behind you:  
_"Why did you come here?"_

You turn around, but the space is emptyâ€”no footsteps, no presence, only the silence pressing in around you.

Before you, the hallway forks into two distinct paths, each shrouded in its own mystery.

**Choices**:  
- [Follow the sound of footsteps](follow-footsteps.md)  
- [Enter the room with the flickering light](enter-room.md)  

---

### **The Spiral Staircase**
The smell of smoke grows stronger as you approach the staircase. Ash coats the wooden railing, and the air feels warmer.

You hesitate, then place your foot on the first step. The floorboards creak sharply beneath you, and you freeze. For a brief moment, you swear you hear someone whisper your name.

**Choices**:  
- [Continue up the stairs](upstairs.md)  
- [Turn back to the hallway](hallway.md)

### **The Basement Door**
The heavy wooden door is cold to the touch. You hear slow, heavy breathing on the other side.

Your curiosity gets the better of you. You twist the rusted doorknob, and the door creaks open to reveal steep stairs leading into darkness.

A dim red light pulses from beneath, casting eerie shadows. A voice slithers from the depths, low and menacing:  
"Step closer..."

**Choices**:  
- [Descend into the basement](basement.md)  
- [Close the door and walk away](walk-away.md)

---

### **The Right Hallway**
You step into the hallway, where a flickering light pulses like a heartbeat. As you move closer, you notice deep scratches carved into the walls. They look like claw marks.

The floor creaks under your weight, and suddenly, the light goes out. You're left in complete darkness.

A low growl echoes from somewhere ahead. Your heart pounds as the sound grows louder.

You see a faint glow ahead.

**Choices**:  
- [Move toward the glow](glow.md)  
- [Run back to the entrance](hallway.md)
