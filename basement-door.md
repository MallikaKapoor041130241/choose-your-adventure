# The Basement Door  

The heavy wooden door is cold to the touch. You hear slow, heavy breathing on the other side.  

Your curiosity gets the better of you. You twist the rusted doorknob, and the door creaks open to reveal steep stairs leading into darkness.  

A faint red glow comes from below. You hear a voice whisper, almost a growl:  
"Come closer..."  

What will you do?

2. [Close the door and walk away](walk-away.md)
