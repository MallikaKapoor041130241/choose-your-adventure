# Descend into the Basement

You take a deep breath and step forward, your feet heavy as they descend the dark staircase. The air grows colder with every step, and the dim red light below flickers like a warning. 

As you reach the bottom, you see the source of the lightâ€”an old furnace, glowing with an unnatural red hue. The air smells of burnt metal and something else... something foul.

Suddenly, the furnace door creaks open, and the voice from earlier echoes through the room:

"Welcome..."
