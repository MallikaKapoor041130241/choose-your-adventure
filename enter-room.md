# Enter the Room with the Flickering Light

You decide to enter the room with the flickering light, your curiosity outweighing the fear that creeps up your spine. As you step inside, the air feels colder, and you notice the room is eerily quiet.

The light above you flickers erratically, casting distorted shadows against the walls. You can just barely make out old furniture covered in dust, and a large mirror stands at the far end of the room. 

Suddenly, the light goes out completely, plunging you into darkness.
