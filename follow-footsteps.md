# Follow the Sound of Footsteps

You decide to follow the faint sound of footsteps echoing from further down the hallway. The noise grows louder, more distinct, yet there is still no one in sight. Your heart beats faster as you approach the sound, now nearly deafening.

As you turn a corner, you see a shadowy figure at the end of the hallway. It stands still, facing the wall, motionless.

Do you:

- [Call out to the figure](call-out-figure.md)
