# Moving Toward the Glow

You cautiously move toward the faint glow, each step sending chills down your spine. The growl grows softer but more menacing, as if the creature is watching you.

The glow brightens, revealing a door slightly ajar. On its surface, ancient symbols pulse faintly with a reddish light.

Suddenly, the growl stops, replaced by soft, mocking laughter from behind the door.
