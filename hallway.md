# Back to the Hallway

You turn, your heart racing, and hurry back down the stairs, your steps heavy and quick. The hallway awaits you, but something is different.

The once-familiar walls are now warped, their shadows stretching unnaturally toward you. The door at the end of the hall is now sealed shut, no longer offering the escape it once did.

The faint sound of footsteps echoes from behind youâ€”someone or something is following.
