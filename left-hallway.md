# The Left Hallway  

You step into the dark hallway. The sound of faint crying grows louder with each step. The air is colder here, and you can barely see. The walls feel damp as you brush your hand against them to guide yourself forward.  

Suddenly, the crying stops. The silence is deafening. You hear a faint whisper directly behind you:  
"Why did you come here?"  

You turn around, but the space is emptyâ€”no footsteps, no presence, only the silence pressing in around you.

Before you, the hallway forks into two distinct paths, each shrouded in its own mystery.

2. [Enter the room with the flickering light](flickering-light.md)
