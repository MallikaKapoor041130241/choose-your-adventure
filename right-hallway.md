# The Right Hallway  

You step into the hallway, where a flickering light pulses like a heartbeat. As you move closer, you notice deep scratches carved into the walls. They look like claw marks.  

The floor creaks under your weight, and suddenly, the light goes out. You're left in complete darkness.  

A low growl echoes from somewhere ahead. Your heart pounds as the sound grows louder.  

You see a faint glow ahead. What will you do?
