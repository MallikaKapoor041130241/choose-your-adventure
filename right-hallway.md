# The Right Hallway  

You step into the hallway, where a flickering light pulses like a heartbeat. As you move closer, you notice deep scratches carved into the walls. They look like claw marks.  

The floor groans beneath your feet, and then, in an instant, the lights flicker and go out. Youâ€™re plunged into utter darkness.

A deep, menacing growl reverberates through the space, growing louder with every passing second. Your pulse races as the sound draws nearer. 

You see a faint glow ahead. What will you do?
