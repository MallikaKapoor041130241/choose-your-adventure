 # Continue Up the Stairs

You push forward, your footfalls slow but determined, each step feeling heavier than the last. The whispering grows louder, echoing off the walls, but it no longer sounds like a voice—it sounds more like a command, urging you upward.

As you reach the top of the staircase, the air is thick with a strange energy. The moment your hand touches the railing at the top, the lights flicker violently. Then, everything goes still.

Suddenly, a figure appears in the corner of your vision—tall, shadowed, and barely human. You freeze, but the figure doesn’t move.

What will you do?
