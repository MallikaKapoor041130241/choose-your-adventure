# Close the Door and Walk Away

You step back, slowly closing the door behind you. The breathing on the other side grows quieter as the door clicks shut, leaving you with a sense of unease. 

The hallway now feels colder, and the faint flickering light seems to have dimmed even more. Just as you're about to turn away, a shadow crosses your path.

You freeze.
